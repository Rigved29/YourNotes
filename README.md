# Your Notes

I made this website using reactjs. In this website we can add notes , edit them and we can delete them as well. With the help searchbar we search for a particular note and with sorting button we can change order of notes list.

I used ReactJS routng,react hooks , react contextAPI , javascript array methods(like map,filter),fetch API,async await,http get,post,put and delete request etc.
when I created this project , I used google firebase for backend and database. But now I created a backend & databse.

It is made using nodeJS, expressJS, mongoDB.
you can checkout backend for this project at: https://github.com/Rigved29/YourNotes-backend
